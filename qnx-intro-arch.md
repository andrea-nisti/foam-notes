# QNX Architecture intro 

#qnx #rtos 

- POSIX compliant 
- [[microkernel]] Architecture
  - `procnto` is the kernel --> [[process manager]] + neutrino ([[microkernel]] name) 
  - drivers processes too

## Neutrino

- handles [threads](process.md), rtos [[scheduling]] and ipc
- reached by kernel calls

## Procnto

- reached with message passing
- pid 1
- handles processes creation and destruction, memory
